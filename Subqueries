Similar results can be achieved without running a subquery, a query can be used on the initial results.
But the data is dynamic causing those results to be obsolete when the top customers make another purchase or if the top five customers change.
Using the subquery on problem one makes it much easier to perform since it is a simple outer query based on the more complex inner query.
With the changing data it is possible that the top customers can be located out of the selected list, thus making it necessary to alter
the subquery to encompass all the countries and cities in the data set. Step two can be done without a subquery by selecting the top 
customers within countries and determining if they are top customers. Since this data has the potential to change a subquery makes it easier to stay up to date with changes.
