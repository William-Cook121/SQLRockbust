# SQLRockbust
Analyzing data for Rockbuster Stealth's business intelligence department to help launch new streaming service. The size of the datset is 3MB and is a .tar file. 
The project began with the creation/ extraction of an entity relationship diagram and a data dictionary. Queries were written to organize, sort, filter, and order
the data. I created a data profile of summary statistics using SQL. Joined tables for more complete data environment. Wrote subqueries and CTEs to answer more 
advanced business questions.
