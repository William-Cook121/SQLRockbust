3.7 Join Queries

1a.
Finding the top ten most popular countries for Rockbuster use requires a query multiple joins across tables that are connected by primary keys. I chose to use COUNT (customer_id) to identify how many customers are in each country. Studying the ERD reveals that customers can be connected to their country of origin through address and city using their respective ‘ids) as primary keys. Grouping the customers by country allows the COUNT function to work on the aggregate data. 

SELECT D.country,
		COUNT (customer_id) AS count_of_customers
FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY count_of_customers DESC LIMIT 10

Country		count_of_customers
"India"		60
"China"		53
"United States"	36
"Japan"		31
"Mexico"	30
"Brazil"		28
"Russian Fed"	28
"Philippines"	20
"Turkey"	15
"Indonesia"	14

This query uses the structure and results from the previous query, but digs deeper into the city and customer table. I chose to select the city along with the country for clarity. Using the WHERE clause to base the top cities on the top countries. 

SELECT C.city, D.country,
		COUNT (customer_id) AS count_of_customers
FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id 
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id 
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 
				  'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY city, country 
ORDER BY count_of_customers DESC LIMIT 10
City		Country			Count
"Aurora"	"United States"		2
"Atlixco"	"Mexico"		1
"Xintai"		"China"			1
"Adoni"		"India"			1
"Dhule (Dhulia)"“India"			1
"Kurashiki"	"Japan"			1
"Pingxiang"	"China"			1
"Sivas"		"Turkey"		1
"Celaya"	"Mexico"		1
"So Leopoldo"	"Brazil"			1
